# Override variables for VirtualBox VM environments
# Copy these settings to .vars.yml when testing in a VM to avoid DNS issues
#
# Alternative usage: ansible-playbook workstation.yml -e @vars-vm.yml

# Disable custom DNS configuration for VMs
# VirtualBox provides its own DNS through NAT (10.0.2.3)
# which doesn't support DNS over TLS
configure_custom_dns: false

# Example .vars.yml for VM:
# ---
# username: your-vm-username
# git_name: Your Name
# git_email: your@email.com
# configure_custom_dns: false
